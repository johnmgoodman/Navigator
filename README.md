Navigator
=========

Navigator is a science fiction fantasy RPG. Lost and utterly alone, the player navigates across the cosmos encountering various galaxies, solar systems and planets. Her life depends on her resolve, her ability to make difficult decisions in the face of strange and extraordinary phenomena. The player's navigation is limited by the resources she finds along her journey.

Navigator is inspired mostly by interactive fiction games, however the gameplay is largely graphical. It's also my first attempt at creating a game in Javascript, CSS and HTML. It is being built with the [CraftJS game library](https://github.com/craftyjs/Crafty).

I'm doing my best to make the game logic data-oriented and modular so that others can add to the adventure without having to delve into the code. The lifeforms, dialogs, spacecraft etc are constructed from JSON data files.
